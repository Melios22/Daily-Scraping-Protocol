#  How to enable SSH for your Raspberry Pi 
By default SSH is disabled on Raspberry Pi (for both if you setting your own or bought the RPi from us).
To Enable SSH:
Open "Raspberry Pi Configuration"
[![](/hc/article_attachments/1500011889561)](/hc/article_attachments/1500011889561)
Select "Interfaces" tab and change SSH to Enable
[![](/hc/article_attachments/1500011889661)](/hc/article_attachments/1500011889661)
Go back to "System" and Change your password to something secured and you know.  
If you create your own SD Card, default Raspberry Pi password is "raspberry" and it's not secured at all.  
If you buy devices from us, you need to change the password to something else to use SSH.

After that you can SSH into your device.
